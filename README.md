# transfer-files-using-sockets



here this is a sample example of how we can use sockets to transfer files through network 
in this project the client will send destination and source file through the command line 
you can see how it can be through the video on YouTube 
and also, I use signals to make a politic way of ending transfer to do two things to release the socket and to close the file 
and to inform the client that server end the transfer 
I hope this project help you to get more deep into sockets and how it work , interact with operating system and the network 

to build this project you only need to open terminal in your project directory and the type make this will generate 
server and client executable files then open another terminal one for client and the other for server so first run server then run your client with the required arguments 

if you press ctrl + c we will see message on the ending of transfer
